# Turing Machine
This is a Turing machine web app. The user can input the rules and the initial state for the Turing machine and it will simulate each step of the turing machine. Displaying the tape on each step and the current rule.

# Installation 
npm install https://github.com/alrossell/Turing.git

# TODO 
A LOT
-Overhaul HTML
-Overhaul CSS
-Implement for turing machine with too many steps
-Implement different types of Turing machines:
    -Turing machine with a halting state
    -One-way Infinite Tape
    -Multiple Tapes
